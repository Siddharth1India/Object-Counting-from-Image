I have used OpenCV to identify and count objects.
I have applied various filters like canny and blur to get best possible image for
opencv for it to identify perfect contours and than used function to draw contours and count length.

Parameters are applied after trying many combinations.

Note: This algorithm doesn't work on count=17 input because it has different color
of background. I can adjust parameters to make it work with that background but than it will 
not work for other images. If project application has specific application in industry, background can be 
selected and accuracy can be really good.
